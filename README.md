# ✈️ Flight Scheduling System (C++)

This is a console-based Flight Scheduling System implemented in C++ using Graph Data Structures and Dijkstra’s Algorithm to determine the shortest travel path between cities.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Add flight routes between cities
- Display all available flight routes
- Find shortest travel path using Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- Input validation and user-friendly menu

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- C++
- Graph Data Structure
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- STL (unordered_map, vector, priority_queue)

▶️ How to Compile and Run


✅ Using g++

g++ main.cpp graph.cpp FlightScheduler.cpp -o flight

./flight

🧠 How It Works

-Cities are stored as graph nodes

-Routes are stored as weighted directed edges

-Dijkstra’s Algorithm is used to calculate the shortest path

📌 Sample Menu
====== Flight Scheduling System ======
1. Add Flight Route
2. Display All Routes
3. Query Shortest Path
4. Exit
